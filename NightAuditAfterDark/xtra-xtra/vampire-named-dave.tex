% have been working the night audit on and off now since 1973. Needless to say, I have seen some things. Some things you wouldn't ever want to see. But even with the traumatic shit I've seen, and the stab wounds that cover my torso, and the nightmares that cause me to wake up screaming in terror each night--I wouldn't give it up for the world. 

% Being a night auditor is more than just a job. It is a lifestyle. 
% "Yes Virginia, there is a vampire, his name is Dave and he works third shift at the SpringHill Suites."

% The sun will become your enemy, you will grow to disdainful of sun light shining through your windows in the daytime. You will need black out curtains, and a strong sense of self destruction. 

% Men who work third shift, live an average of 8 years less than others. If you're unmarried, go ahead and subtract 9 more years from the old ticker. It's gonna be a short one my man.
% Well, good luck. And don't call me when I'm off. I'll be asleep.
